Right now this thing boots and writes "testerder" to the screen.
It's my first go on an OS :).

just run build.sh in the main directory and it should build (tested on linux MINT 8)

for the building process I use a seperate toolchain that builds to i586 wich you can install in ubuntu
by first doing
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

add the following lines to the list
#the first one was not working last time
#deb http://www.pedigree-project.org/debian/ stable main    #Primary Mirror. Hosted by OrOS.
deb http://www.tucs.org.au/~jscott4/debian/ stable main    #Primary Mirror. Hosted by University of Tasmania.

then add the keys for the repo
gpg --recv-keys 0x2F90DE4A
gpg -a --export 0x2F90DE4A | sudo apt-key add -

and finally install the cross compiler (you may have to set your $PATH right so it 
includes all the i586-elf... files)

Enjoy!
