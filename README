FEATURES
--------
Initialize memory
intializes irq/isrs
keyboard input works
minimal(very minimal) console works


TO USE IT
---------
use virtualbox or vmware or whatever virtual machine thingy you want to use
and use the bin/floppy.img as floppy disk.

You can also write it to an actual floppy :| and boot from it
or you can convert it to iso an burn it on a cd and boot from that


TO BUILD IT
-----------
Just run build.sh in the main directory and it should build (tested on linux MINT 8 64bit)

It generates a bin/floppy.img wich you can use in virtualbox(or vmware) to boot from.

for the building process I use a seperate cross compile toolchain that builds to i586 wich you can install in ubuntu/mint

Installing the cross compile toolchain (thanks to http://www.pedigree-project.org/)
--------------------------------------

first do
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

add the following lines to the list
#the first one was not working last time
#deb http://www.pedigree-project.org/debian/ stable main    #Primary Mirror. Hosted by OrOS.
deb http://www.tucs.org.au/~jscott4/debian/ stable main    #Primary Mirror. Hosted by University of Tasmania.

then add the keys for the repo
gpg --recv-keys 0x2F90DE4A
gpg -a --export 0x2F90DE4A | sudo apt-key add -

and finally install the cross compiler (you may have to set your $PATH right so it 
includes all the i586-elf... files)

UPDATE: the libmpfr1ldbl (which is needed for i586..) package  is no longer present in the debian repositories so it will soon vanish,
you can still download it for squeeze though.

Enjoy!
