FEATURES

TO USE IT
---------
use virtualbox or vmware or whatever virtual machine thingy you want to use
and use the bin/floppy.img as floppy disk.

You can also write it to an actual floppy :| and boot from it
or you can convert it to iso an burn it on a cd and boot from that


TO BUILD IT
-----------
Just run build.sh in the main directory and it should build (tested on debian testing)

It generates a bin/floppy.img wich you can use in virtualbox(or vmware) to boot from.

the run.sh script runs a build image in Qemu
the debug.sh script runs a build image in Qemu and attaches gdb as a debugger
